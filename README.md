This was one of the first projects I did when I started learning coding with Zaio Coding School. 
It's a part of what they teach. This is my online business card. So I can use this communicate with potential clients and business partners abroad.
Just as in real seminars you leave a business card, so in virtual ones you leave a digital one.
There is also a QR code I generated as well that I have stored on my smartphone so that if I meet people in real life they can scan it and get immediate access to my business card. This is much more efficient than distributing out actual business cards and a lot quicker.
