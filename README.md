This was one of the first projects I did when I started learning coding with Zaio Coding School. 
It's a part of what they teach. This is my online business card. So I can use this communicate with potential clients and business partners abroad.
JUst as in real seminars you leave a business card, so in virtual ones you leave a digital one.
